    <h3>More than 5,000 schools so far have chosen to teach International Baccalaureate® (IB) programmes,<br> with their unique academic rigour and their emphasis on students’ personal development.<br> Those schools employ over 70,000 educators, teaching more than one million students worldwide.</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>must fulfill three core requirements(in addition to passing his or her subject examinations)</li>
    <li>Candidates must write an independent research essay of up to 4,000 words in a subject from the list of approved EE subjects.</li>
    <li>TOK is the one course that all diploma candidates are required to take.</li>
    <li>A CAS project must be completed</li>
    </ul>
     <h3> There are six subject groups in the IB program</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Group 1: Studies in language and literature. <br>Taken at either SL or HL, this is generally the student's native language, with over 80 languages available.[27] As of courses starting in summer 2011, there are two options for Language A (previously A1): Literature, which is very similar to the old course, and Language and Literature, a slightly more challenging adaptation of the former Group 2 Language A2 subjects, which have been withdrawn. The interdisciplinary subject Literature and Performance can also be taken at SL.</li>
      <li>Group 2: Language acquisition. <br>An additional language, taken at the following levels: Language B (SL or HL), or Language ab initio (SL only).[28] Latin and Classical Greek are also offered and may be taken at SL or HL.[27] Following the replacement of the Language A2 option with the Group 1 Language and Literature offering for courses starting in summer 2011, the Language B syllabus was changed: the coursework is now more rigorous, and at HL, there is the compulsory study of two works of literature (although this is for comprehension rather than analysis and is only assessed through coursework). In addition, B SL students can study one of the texts as a replacement for the optional topics.</li>
      <li>Group 3: Individuals and societies.<br> Humanities and social sciences courses offered at both SL and HL: Business Management, Economics, Geography, History, Information Technology in a Global Society (ITGS), Philosophy, Psychology, and Social and Cultural Anthropology and Global Politics.[29] The course World Religions and the interdisciplinary course Environmental Systems and Societies are also offered at SL only.</li>
     <li>Group 4: Experimental sciences. <br>Five courses are offered at both SL and HL: Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Design Technology and Computer Science. The course Sport, Exercise and Health Science and the interdisciplinary courses Environmental Systems and Societies and Nature of Science are offered at SL only.</li>
      <li>Group 5: Mathematics.<br> In order of increasing difficulty, the courses offered are Mathematical Studies SL, Mathematics SL and HL, and Further Mathematics HL. The computer science elective courses were moved to Group 4 as a full course from first examinations in 2014.[30] In 2019, major changes to the IB Math curriculum will remove all previous Math SLs and HLs and replace them with Mathematics: Applications and Interpretation SL and HL and Mathematics: Analysis and Approaches SL and HL, with Mathematics: Applications intended to be similar to Mathematical Studies and Mathematics: Analysis to be similar to Mathematics, with Further Mathematics being dropped entirely.[</li>
    <li> Group 6: The arts.<br> Courses offered at both SL and HL: Dance, foreign languages, Music, Theatre, Visual Arts, and Film.[32] In lieu of taking a Group 6 course, students may choose to take an additional course from Groups 1–4 or either Further Mathematics HL (if already studying Mathematics HL) a Computer science course from Group 4, or a school-based syllabus course approved by IB.[25][33] The interdisciplinary subject Literature and Performance is also offered, although currently only at SL.</li>
